This repository contains an [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) encoding of the first 111 measures of
**Symphony No. 4** by Gustav Mahler,
following the [Ludwig Doblinger Edition, Plate 33, 1902](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/64566),
arranged for four hands by Josef Venantius Wöss (1863–1943).
In the original edition, primo and secondo are printed on separate pages; this encoding combines both parts into one score.

This encoding has been generated as part of the TROMPA project. No assurances are made regarding the validity or consistency of this encoding or its structure.
